Module Guide: src/analysis/
================================

__init__.py
    Marks the directory as a Python package; no runtime logic.

class_imbalance.py
    Samples training and validation images, trains an SGD-based logistic model, and reports per-class accuracy along with confusion matrix plots for imbalance diagnostics.

config.py
    Central location for dataset and output directory paths via `DatasetConfig` and `OutputConfig` dataclasses.

data_quality.py
    Performs duplicate detection with perceptual hashes and flags low-confidence or contradictory labels using a RandomForest baseline.

feature_exploration.py
    Runs multi-scale intensity/edge statistics, Grad-CAM attention visualisations, and inter-class embedding similarity analysis.

geometric.py
    Computes edge-density and flip-difference statistics to understand geometric characteristics of sample images.

image_stats.py
    Iterates across datasets to compute per-image pixel statistics, aggregate summaries, and histogram visualisations.

label_analysis.py
    Calculates class distribution metrics for train/val splits and exports comparison charts and summary tables.

latent_structure.py
    Builds PCA+t-SNE embeddings from flattened images to inspect latent structure across labels.

quality_checks.py
    Samples grids of images per class, checks for missing files, and prepares quick visual QA reports for each data split.

robustness.py
    Applies perturbations (noise, blur, contrast) to sample images, logs PSNR/SSIM metrics, and exports comparison figures.

robustness_deepdive.py
    Extends robustness work with frequency-domain analysis, adversarial attacks (FGSM/PGD), and occlusion sensitivity maps.

run_pipeline.py
    Orchestrates the full analysis pipeline, setting up logging and executing all module entry points in sequence.

test_characterization.py
    Compares train/val/test distributions via pixel, edge, texture, and anomaly metrics, including PCA-based feature comparisons.

utils.py
    Shared helpers for loading CSV labels, reading images, ensuring output directories, saving results, and chunking iterables.
